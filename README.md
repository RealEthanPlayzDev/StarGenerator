Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.0.0.

Roblox module for generating stars.

# Usage
``function StarGenerator.Generate(count: number, posdef: posv3 | posnumber, acolors: {Color3}, folder: Instance, size: Vector3?)``

Used to generate stars.
- count: number = Amount of stars
- posdef: posv3 | posnumber = (See the types definition)
- acolors: {Color3}? = An array filled with Color3s to override default colors (optional)
- folder: Instance? = Optional place to parent the stars into
- size: Vector3 = Optional star size
  
``type posv3 = {pos1=Vector3, pos2=Vector3?}``
- pos1: Vector3 = Main vector of the position for randomisation
- pos2: Vector3 = Optional, second vector, if not defined then the positions will be randomised between -pos1 and pos1 else it will be randomised between pos1 and pos2

``type posnumber = {pos1: number, pos2: number?, minheight: number?, maxheight: number?}``
- pos1: number = Main number position for randomisation
- pos2: number? = Optional, second number position for randomisation, if not defined then the positions will be randomised between -pos1 and pos1, else it will be randomised between pos1 and pos2
- minheight: number? = Optional, minimum height of star generation for randomisation
- maxheight: number? = Optional, maximum height of star generation for randomisation

Note that if minheight or maxheight are not defined, height will always be at 500 studs

ALL NUMBERS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN STUDS
